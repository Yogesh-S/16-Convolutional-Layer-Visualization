# 16-Convolutional-Layer-Visualization

Let us visualize four filtered outputs (a.k.a. activation maps) of a convolutional layer. 

In this example, we are defining four filters that are applied to an input image by initializing the **weights** of a convolutional layer, but a trained CNN will learn the values of these weights.
